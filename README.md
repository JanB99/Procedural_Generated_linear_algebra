# Procedural Generated library for linear algebra in C++

- Basic vector operations are implemented.
- I plan on adding support for matrix math.
- Useful for the maths used in graphical programming (games, art, etc.).

I'm taking a course in metaprogramming and I've been learning C++ for a short while now, hence why I thought it could be fun to write a program that procedural generates a linear algebra library.
